# Hatstack
Hatstack is a group of Fontys students interested in digital security. We meet every Thursday afternoon and frequently participate in hacking competitions (CTFs). Sometimes we find vulnerable stuff, hack it, and tell each other how it was done. Other times we hold a competition ourselves, like during open days or on the Hatstack Village at NEXT.

Other stuff
Internal CTF
There's a CTF running on https://192.168.13.10/ @ seclab. Will run until next week or until the next hacknight. Depends on how fast things get solved. You can ask for hints on IRC. Keep hints in private messages please to avoid spoiling things.
